## Introduction
The Titanic webapp is a program I developed to estimate the likelihood of a created person to survive the sinking of the Titanic. 
The webapp is contained in another webapp that shows off all my projects I've done to date. I will be running through the differnt screens of the webapps as a kind of TLDR. Let's begin!

## Initial Screen
So on booting the webapp and going to localhost:8000/projectsShower in a browser, we're treated to this screen:

Here we see the inital screen displaying all the webapps in this repository. At the moment it's only one but as I do more projects this number will hopefully grow! Images of the actual code are yet to be added but they're all in the repository

If we click on the "Read More" button we now see this screen(again code images not yet here :( )

On this page we get a more in-depth look on an individual project. We can see the technologies used and a little about the project. We can actually launch the project by pressing the big blue "Launch Project" button.

We're now treated to the "Homepage" of the webapp, a list of people who we're aboard the Titanic and also previously created persons. If you look at the top of the screen, you can see a few tabs that redirect to other pages of the app, which we'll go through in a moment. 
(Home, Search,Graphs,Person Creation) are the tabs at the top. 

The home button will return us to the projects selection screen as previoulsy shown.

Search is our current and has a list of people, with each person being clickable to see more details. If we click on the first person in the list, we see this screen:

Here we can get a more indepth look of a person with everything in the database about that person. If we return to the search page, we can search for people in the database using numerous details such as name, id and ticket. If we search for "rander" we get this result back:

![alt text](https://github.com/foesa/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/WebApp%20Images/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-17%2015-42-34.png)

On this page we get returned a list of people matching the search criteria. There's only one result as only one person in the database has this name. We can click on this result to get an indepth page on the person.

Now if we click the "Graph" link, this page is returned:

![alt text](https://github.com/foesa/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/WebApp%20Images/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-17%2015-41-34.png)

This is a page of graphs based of the data. This is used to provide a graphical breakdown of the data. Now to the main part, the "Person Creation" page!

![alt text](https://github.com/foesa/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/WebApp%20Images/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-17%2015-41-39.png)

Here we see the main attraction, the person creation page. Here it's blank. After filling out the values we get this form:

![alt text](https://github.com/foesa/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/WebApp%20Images/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-17%2015-42-44.png)

After clicking "Submit" we are sent to the results page:

![alt text](https://github.com/foesa/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/WebApp%20Images/Screenshot%20from%202019-10-17%2015-42-21.png)

From here we can create a new person, or go to the search page and find created people or anyone else in the database.
